# Credit_Card_Analytics_PowerBi

I'm excited to share my latest data analytics project, a comprehensive Power BI dashboard focused on Credit Card Customer & Transaction Reporting. This project demonstrates my proficiency in data visualization, business intelligence, and providing actionable insights from raw data.

Project Highlights:

Holistic View: The dashboard is divided into two key reports: a Customer Report and a Transaction Report. This dual approach provides a 360-degree view of credit card performance, from customer behavior to transaction trends.

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs): I've created several key metrics to measure performance, including total revenue ($55M), total interest ($7.84M), and transaction count (655.7K).

Customer Segmentation: The Customer Report segment users by various attributes such as card type (Silver, Blue, Gold, Platinum), gender, job type, marital status, and income group. This level of detail allows for a deep understanding of who is using credit cards and how.

Transaction Analysis: The Transaction Report breaks down revenue by card type, expenditure type, and transaction count. It also visualizes the quarterly revenue by transaction count, providing insights into seasonal trends.

Geographic Insights: The dashboard includes a "Revenue by State" visual, which helps identify the most lucrative regions for credit card usage.

Technical Skills: This project showcases my skills in Power BI Desktop, DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) for custom calculations, and data modeling to create a single, cohesive dataset from multiple sources.

This project was a fantastic opportunity to apply my data analytics skills to a real-world scenario, uncovering valuable insights that can drive strategic business decisions. I'm proud of the result and look forward to building on these skills in future projects.
